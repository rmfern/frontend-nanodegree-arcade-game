## Running the game
===============================
Click 'Clone or download' then click 'Download ZIP.' Once the file is downloaded, extract the contents and open 'index.html' in a browser of your choice.

## Rules of the game
===============================
The idea of the game is based off of the classic 'Frogger' design - make it to the top of the game board without running into any of the bugs as they make their way across the screen.

## Game controls
===============================
The Up, Down, Left, and Right keyboard keys are all you'll need for this one. It's simple!
