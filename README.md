frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game
===============================
Small project part of the [www.udacity.com](https://www.udacity.com/) Front-end web developer nanodegree.
## Running the game
Download the repo's ZIP [here](https://github.com/rmfern/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/archive/master.zip). Once the file is downloaded, extract the contents and open 'index.html' in a browser of your choice.

## Rules of the game
The idea of the game is based off of the classic 'Frogger' design - make it to the top of the game board without running into any of the bugs as they make their way across the screen.

## Game controls
The Up, Down, Left, and Right keyboard keys are all you'll need for this one. It's simple!
